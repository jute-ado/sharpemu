## Info

SharpEmu is an early-stage emulator developed for research and educational
purposes. It focuses exclusively on PlayStation 5 software; PS4 emulation is
outside the project's scope.

## Status

The emulator can load `eboot.bin`, ELF, SELF, PRX, and system-module images,
execute native x86-64 guest code, dispatch a growing HLE surface, translate AGC
shaders to SPIR-V/Vulkan, and present video for some games.

Current capabilities include:

- ELF/SELF loading, relocation, imports, TLS, and module initialization
- Native CPU execution with structured trap and execution diagnostics
- Application metadata and content-bundle inspection
- Partial kernel, libc, Fiber, AMPR, PlayGo, audio, input, and savedata support
- Vulkan video output on Windows and Linux and MoltenVK output on macOS
- Windows, Linux, and macOS x64 release archives

Platform support remains experimental. Compatibility and performance vary by
game, operating system, and GPU driver.

## Using

Download the release archive for your operating system, extract it, and launch
SharpEmu with the path to a legally obtained game's `eboot.bin`.

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\SharpEmu.exe "C:\path\to\game\eboot.bin" 2>&1 |
  Tee-Object -FilePath "SharpEmu.log"
```

Linux and macOS:

```bash
chmod +x ./SharpEmu
./SharpEmu "/path/to/game/eboot.bin" 2>&1 | tee SharpEmu.log
```

A Vulkan-capable GPU and current graphics driver are required. The macOS
release includes the MoltenVK Vulkan implementation.

## Games Tested

* **Demon's Souls Remake**
  * [Demon's Souls [PPSA01341]](https://github.com/sharpemu/sharpemu/issues/2)
  * Demon's Souls is now video loop. Shaders are ready to be converted to SPIR-V/Vulkan. We are continuing our work on this.

## Build

1. Install the .NET SDK version specified in [`global.json`](./global.json).
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/sharpemu/sharpemu.git`
3. Open the solution file (`SharpEmu.slnx`) in **VSCode**.
4. Build the project: `dotnet build` or `dotnet publish`
5. Build artifacts will be located in the `artifacts` directory.

## Special Thanks

The following projects were extremely helpful during development:

* **[ShadPS4](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4)**  
Helped with understanding the basic architecture of the PlayStation 4.

* **[Kyty](https://github.com/InoriRus/Kyty)**  
One of the few PS5 emulator projects available and very useful for studying native code execution.

* **Ryujinx**  
Provided valuable references for filesystem handling and low-level C# implementation patterns.
